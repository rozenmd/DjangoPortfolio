        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="lead">My name is <a href="https://maxrozen.com">Max Rozen</a>, and I have recently graduated from the University of Sydney, with a Bachelor of Engineering (Software)/Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Finance. I'm comfortable both in implementing APIs, and wiring them up to user interfaces, so you could call me a full-stack developer </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When I'm not writing fun little projects like Can I Go Outside Yet, I'm either travelling, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/92550063@N04/" target=_blank>taking photos</a>, or figuring out which camera to buy next.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="lead">
        	 I'm looking for a job, and am interested in working with SQL/NoSQL, Apache Spark and the Hadoop ecosystem, C#/Java or HTML5/CSS3 in a Data-Focused role. Think "Big Data" Analytics, Data Science, that sort of thing.
